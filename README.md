# OperationFC
A forensic investigation seeking to identify sources of system-destabilizing corruption
<br />
I recently reached out to the San Francisco Police Department via 911 potentially afraid for my life.  Not that there was someone pointing a shotgun at me directly, but that after years of understanding I was a target of unwelcome, unsolicited, unhealthy attention I was concerned that I might have gotten close enough to a name and that the name was well know and well resourced enough that, along with personal experience and some events that I might not have understood at the time of their passing as relevant, I was worried I might both "know to much" and "be adequately credible" to invite escalation from psycho-social mob violence to the poisoned darts and brickbats kind.
<br />
The officer I spoke with, who didn't insist on coming over or demand the room number in my building, came across as attentive and reasonably credible.  But they insisted they needed something that tied my current "person of interest" directly to me.  Something independently verifiable.  I gave them the names of a couple people who might have some information, but might be reluctant to come forward, and pointed out that I had a good deal of drives with operating systems and data that might include evidence of intrusion efforts.  It's on that latter I'd like to focus here.
<br />
If you have the time to offer advice, expertise, effort, corroborating information or critical support, I could really use it.  While I'm a novice when it comes to git, generally, and GitHub specifically, I have worked with content versioning software in the past and I thought this might as good a place to publish notes on research, archives of systems logs, device backups or links thereto, discussions of tactics or strategy, legal references, beauerucratic forms and so forth.  At the very list, I can provide my contact information.
<br />
Having recently re-published a bare-bones landing page for public(ish) consumption, I have a phone that needs backing up because the Android OS running the UI clearly isn't the OS running the bare metal, if you will (DNS requests are coming back from servers I never use and can't be found in my settings, strange locations pop up under called numbers indicating that my calls are, in fact, subject to MITM taps -- including 911 and 311 calls from the carrier number -and- regular calls from a Google Voice number, and so forth.  Not sure if ADB will actually get everything-everything (pretty sure it won't) so short of SOIC is there a way to get past the VM to the Hypervisor?
<br />
The good news is that the hubris of the soulless monsters doing the surveillance and harrassment means they have not packed out what they packed in. Ever.  Sloppy doesn't begin to describe it, thought at this point people may be deliberately screwing up to offer me acknowledgement and themselves and their consciences some hope of a way out.
<br />
Really, though, please just reach out.  I know I have often gotten things wildly wrong. Wildly wrong!  But I can demonstrate that, sadly, the essence of what I feared might be true is.  And I'm not sure even many of those who may feel personally or primarly resonsible understand how much bigger than them it was, or has become, and should probably be warned and invited in before shunned and scorned.  So if I have, apologies.  Sincerely.
