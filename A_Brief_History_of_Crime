TK work in progress

Since approximately 2016, my "love language" has largely been rambling, maybe possible by largely implausible emails full of accusations of betrayal.  As a tactic for eliciting support during a dangerously stressful time, it has failed miserably.  As a means of providing cover to anyone I've ever loved or even cared about, hopefully it's been somewhat more successful.  As a wise man oft repeats, "If it don't apply, let it fly."
<br /><br />
At the very least, hopefully it's been clear that something has been horribly wrong, and while I acknowledge I have not always contributed positively toward constructive resolution of the situation, hopefully by now people are in a better position to understand that my choices are not the fundamental problem.  In the last eight years and more, I have made different, sometimes even better choices.  I have, actually, matured, learned and grown.  And while the intensity of destabilizing violence has varied in intensity, it has not ceased as a persistent threat.  And it is not just a threat to me -- because it has served and will continue to serve as a warning to anyone else who has the courage and temerity to stand up for their rights under the law that they do so at grave risk to their lives and the lives of those around them.
<br /><br />
What I have experienced is consistent in at least some respects with destabilization campaigns carried out by organizations like the NKVD, Stasi, Mukhabharat and CIA among others.  And while I remain cautiously optimistic that the vast majority of complicity has been effectively coerced, and that people as a rule (with exceptions) can be relied upon to do the honest, sustainable, legal, consensual and healthy thing if given the opportunity to choose for themselves in relative freedom and safety, the number of institutions -- both public and private -- that are implicated is potentially staggering.
<br /><br />
Is my grandiosity blowing this all way out of proportion?  I sure hope so!  But even if we're talking about one police department, or one publicly-traded corporation, or one regional political party operation, that's a big enough problem that someone could find themselves on the losing end of a cyncial calculation as to whether it would be cheaper to come clean and have an insurer cover a legal settlement or simply eliminate anyone with standing and thereby eliminate the liability.  Make it two out of those three, or three of one, and you can see how a human life might hardly register as a rounding error to those bound by fiduciary duty.
<br /><br />
I have already survived at least two explicit attempts to derail my life in a way that might prevent me from pursuing any perpetrators.  In 2018 I was "slipped a mickey" while at work, and the inexplicably sudden inebriation I experienced after taking medication in an effort to cope with the extraordinary stress of being targeted for mob violence was pretext enough for being fired for cause from my part-time job at the City and County of San Francisco's Recreation and Parks Department.  With that job went my housing, leaving me with a choice of leaving town or trying my luck on the streets.
<br /><br />
My only hesitation in leaving town was the fear that whatever crime I'd been a victim of in San Francisco could just as easily be organized in Washington State, and if so there was little point in disrupting what little of my own life was left and inviting any of the mayhem and chaos into the lives of my aging parents.  But as everyone still available for consultation urged a departure, I tried to accept it as I would commit to a decision made of my own free will.  Of course, shortly after arriving it was abundantly clear that, once again, whatever had worked to poison wells of personal opinion ahead of any chance I might have to make an independent first impression was still salient in Skagit County.  
<br /><br />
While I remember some of the time I spent there fondly, and have nothing but gratitude to my family and many others who did their best to help wether or not they were aware of my exile-in-situ or not, after nearly three years things had begun to intensify once again, or I perceived it did, and really, in the absence of any capacity to reality test, what's the functional difference?  There is none.  What's so insidious is that even one day out of one hundred is enough to invite distrust and fuel suspicion that can't be allayed by any means into the other ninety-nine.  Whatever anyone may have been told about "positive outcomes" or "achievable goals" or "good intentions," there is literally no possibility that such unacknowledged surveillance and intrusion can be in any way constructive towards any end beyond complex PTSD, stress-induced biological decline and increasing isolation.  None.  That is the only purpose it can possibly serve, and the primary instigators have known that since no later than 2004, maybe as early as 1999.
<br /><br />
Fearing for what it was doing to the relationships with my immediate family my life is largely contingent upon, and having to make the difficult choice between staying to help my father care for my mother after her diagnosis of alzheimers and early-onset dementia at the cost and with the risks attendant to the ongoing stalking which had a foothold among neighbors, healthcare providers, law enforcement professionals and your run-of-the-mill hobbyist fascists just enthusiastic about smearing queers!  Woooo-boy-howdy!  I decided to try my luck elsewhere, and while I didn't initially set out to return to San Francisco, my experiences everywhere else led me to the conclusion that if I was going to find a bully to corner and confront, it was as likely to be here as anywhere.
<br /><br />
Of course, by April of 2021 I'd already abandoned Eureka and been rather brutally received in Santa Cruz, where my vehicle was abandoned after having been forcibly disabled -- presumably by the people I recognized from weeks before and hundreds of miles away in Oregon who had clearly continued tailing me even after I caught them tailing me and coralled them in a parking lot.  Which, if they had any concern about being caught or positively identified, should have been enough to burn them.  But there has been, and remains, little in the way of interest, enthusiasm and maybe even expertise in actually covering any tracks.  It's been enough to rely on the bigotry which kneecaps my credibility and the isolation which robs me of support.
<br /><br />
On the street, and having lost access to any medical care in the hiatus caused by a transfer of Medi-Cal from one county to another, I began to self-medicate as I had before 2018.  With nowhere safe to sleep, hypervigilance exactly appropriate as a stance and an as-yet-insurmountable task of finding a way to address the ongoing violence while the object of it, I will count survival at all as a victory.  It took months of harassment, until eventually I was threatened by shopkeeps with weapons, hunted by dogs led by handlers and increasingly limited in my access to communications (to this day, the IT staff at the Public Library shut off basic functionality like Notepad to slow me down, which still hasn't been restored) and became so desperate for a confrontation I sought to draw out my attackers with vandalism directed at what I suspected were resources they had employed, such as the multi-unit to single-family dwelling at 1 Enterprise, or a pair of cars on Geneva Avenue near Bayshore which, in retrospect, I'm not sure were even street legal and for all I know may have been pulled from Daly City or San Mateo County's impound lot.
<br /><br />
Both landed me in jail, the latter for seven months.  Despite clearly being a candidate for mental health diversion, the San Mateo County District Attorney did everything they could to ensure I took a strike and the judge cooperated without hesitation.  Even if it wasn't crooked, were it considered in the context of the organized campaign of exclusion from civil society I find it hard to believe it would be considered just or humane.  The insistence on the part of the DA's office to demand my registration as an arsonist -- a scarlett letter akin to but rarer and more expensive to insure than inclusion on the sex offender registry -- seems particularly suspect in the way it drastically limited my options for programs as a sentencing alternative to jail time, narrowing my choice essentially down to Positive Directions and only Positive Directions.
<br /><br />
Which is not to suggest that PD was in any way central, or even aware, of any of this background when I came into their care.  I certainly went into the program intending to do my best to comply despite reservations, and while I wasn't a perfect client, I do not believe I actively undermined or interfered with anyone else's effort and overall was aa positive, productive a member of the community as anyone, which I'm pretty proud of considering the challenges I was up against.  I do wonder to what degree my initial case manager (who shall here remain nameless) may have been aware of the atypical if not unique interest my case attracted.  I do believe at some point I was suggested to the security detail for the Mayor's office -- starting, likely, with Newsom and through to even the Laurie administration now -- as a "suspicious person" and may have been noted as such.
<br /><br />
(Despite some chilly interactions with her security detail directly the two times I approached her office at City Hall in an effort, however misguided, to warn her as to the liability to the city my case possibly represented, I hold out hope that former Mayor Breed understood I was not a threat to her and maybe even kept an eye out for me.  I know on the occassions when our paths crossed at public events I did my best to keep a respectful distance so as not to make anyone anxious.  Regardless, I have immense respect for her courage on her )
